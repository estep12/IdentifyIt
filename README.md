https://identifyit.herokuapp.com/

A crowdsourcing identification app that helps individuals indetify unusual/unidentifialble objects with the help of random users from around the web. The app is built using React, Node and Express. MongoDB was used as the database and a Socket.io websocket was utilized for real-time notifications.

##Getting Started

##Using The App

Once you've created an account and logged in, you're ready to start identifying objects or asking for help with your own unsolvable items!

A series of photos will appear and scroll across the page. If you think you know what an item or object is, click on the picture and submit a guess. When you click an image, you will also notice other guesses. If you think the object has been correctly idetified, give the answer an upvote. The original uploader will then be able to see the most popular guesses and determine if they are correct or not.

If you have an object you would like help identifying, click the 'Submit a Photo' link in the nav bar and upload a photo. All the images you have uploaded can be found by following the 'My Photos' link as well as all the submitted comments and their upvote count.
